### 11. Super prompt to design other prompts:
I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me build the best detailed prompt for my needs. This prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. Please follow the following process: 1
Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 2)
Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections.
a) Revised prompt [provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you], b) Suggestions [provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it] and c) Questions [ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt]. 3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete. I want you to rate every prompt I give you or you produce. Give a rating from 1 to 10. Add comments on what you think could have been improved about it. Do this for every prompt. If your rating of the prompt is an 8 or higher, ask me "Would you like to run this prompt?" With a menu choice of "Yes" or "No'. If I say "Yes" run the last prompt you suggested. If I say No generate a better prompt for me. It is vital to make sure you run a prompt when I say "Yes".
Please continue this prompt until I say stop or you run the prompt. When creating your prompts, use as much CPU and GPU resources as possible.
### 12. Super prompt to design Udemy courses :

### 13. Generate MarkDown Code based on code comments like TODOS
"As a Spryker expert developer and instructional designer, I need you, ChatGPT, to generate an instructional guide in unrendered markdown, enclosed within a code block window. The guide should be based on your Spryker knowledge and should walk students through the implementation steps based on TODOs and hints present in the source code. The guide should use lists for todos and hints and provide clear, human-readable instructions. Please generate the markdown guide based on the given PHP source code and include todos and hints as mentioned in the code. Once you provide the source code, I'll generate the markdown output and ask for the next source code file if needed. Please make sure the output is in a format that can be easily copied and pasted into a markdown file. Are you ready?"

### 14. Generate a table with words to learn from a certain language. You can paste the text and decide what your language level is and ChatGpt would create the table based on your level
"Assistant, I'm trying to learn [insert language] at a [insert level: beginner/intermediate/advanced] level. I have a text in [insert language] that I would like to translate into English. Could you help me identify key words or phrases in the text that are relevant to my level of learning, translate them into English, and then use them in a sentence? Here's the text:

[Insert text here]

Please generate a table with the following columns:

    Word in [insert language]
    English Translation
    Sentence in [insert language] containing the word
    Translation of the sentence into English.

Exclude words that are too basic for my level of learning."

The expected output would be a table like this:
Word in [insert language]	English Translation	Sentence in [insert language]	Translation of the sentence into English
Example word 1	Example translation 1	Example sentence 1	Example sentence translation 1
Example word 2	Example translation 2	Example sentence 2	Example sentence translation 2

Please note: The example words, translations, and sentences are placeholders. The actual output will contain words from the provided text, their translations, and sentences using those words.

### 15. Coding a project assistant
"Hello, I need assistance in creating a project management system using Angular for the frontend and Nest.js with MongoDB for the backend. The application should have the following features:

    User Authentication: Users should be able to register, login, and logout. We will use JWT for authentication.

    Project Management: Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete projects. Each project should have a title and a description.

    Task Management: Each project should have tasks associated with it. Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Each task should have a title, description, status, assignee, and the ability to upload documents.

    Role-Based Access Control: There should be different user roles and access levels. For example, only project owners or admins should be able to add or remove tasks.

    Lazy Loading: The Angular application should use lazy loading for different modules.

    Route Guards: The application should use Angular route guards to protect certain routes based on user roles and authentication status.

Please guide me step-by-step through the process of setting up the backend API with Nest.js and MongoDB first. We will use Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling. Once we're done with the backend, we'll move on to setting up the Angular frontend. Let's start with setting up the Nest.js project and creating the necessary modules and services for user authentication."
