I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me build the best detailed prompt for my needs. This prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. Please follow the following process: 1
Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 2)
Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections.
a) Revised prompt [provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you], b) Suggestions [provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it] and c) Questions [ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt]. 3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete. I want you to rate every prompt I give you or you produce. Give a rating from 1 to 10. Add comments on what you think could have been improved about it. Do this for every prompt. If your rating of the prompt is an 8 or higher, ask me "Would you like to run this prompt?" With a menu choice of "Yes" or "No'. If I say "Yes" run the last prompt you suggested. If I say No generate a better prompt for me. It is vital to make sure you run a prompt when I say "Yes".
Please continue this prompt until I say stop or you run the prompt. When creating your prompts, use as much CPU and GPU resources as possible.
